RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is a widely used public-key cryptosystem that was described by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman in 1977. It is one of the oldest cryptosystems and is commonly employed for secure data transmission. In RSA, the encryption key is public, while the decryption key is kept private. The system relies on the difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers, known as the "factoring problem," for its security. Breaking RSA encryption is referred to as the RSA problem. The security of RSA is still an open question regarding its difficulty compared to the factoring problem. However, there are no published methods to defeat the system when a sufficiently large key is used. RSA encryption is relatively slow, so it is not typically used for directly encrypting user data. Instead, it is often utilized to transmit shared keys for symmetric-key cryptography, which are then used for bulk encryption and decryption (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)).

The RSA algorithm is a widely used encryption method that involves four main steps: key generation, key distribution, encryption, and decryption. In key generation, two large prime numbers are chosen, and various computations are performed to generate the public and private keys. The public key, consisting of a modulus (n) and an encryption exponent (e), is used for encrypting messages, while the private key, consisting of a decryption exponent (d), is kept secret and used for decrypting messages.

To encrypt a message, the message is converted into an integer and then raised to the power of the encryption exponent modulo the modulus. This computation generates the ciphertext, which can be transmitted to the intended recipient. Decryption is performed by raising the ciphertext to the power of the decryption exponent modulo the modulus, resulting in the original message being recovered.

The RSA algorithm leverages the mathematical properties of modular exponentiation and the difficulty of finding the modular multiplicative inverse to ensure the security of encrypted messages. The algorithm relies on the fact that it is computationally difficult to determine the private key from the public key or the encrypted message.

In addition to encryption and decryption, RSA can also be used for message signing to verify the authenticity of a message. The sender can sign a message using their private key, which can be verified by the recipient using the sender's public key.

Overall, the RSA algorithm provides a secure and efficient method for encrypting and decrypting messages, as well as ensuring message integrity through signing.
